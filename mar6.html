    <p><strong>Excel</strong>: Download <a href="https://www.strongspace.com/shared/txbp1u8ang">this CSV</a> of Census data from U.S. congressional districts and open it in Excel. Each of you has been <a href="https://gist.github.com/dwillis/5016672">assigned a state</a> to focus on. Using a filter, isolate the rows for your state, and then do the following:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Create a column to calculate each district's percentage of the total population that the 20-24 year-old age range represents. Which district has the highest percentage of 20-24 year olds?</li>
      <li>Do the same thing for Veteran Status:Civilian Veterans. Which district has the lowest percentage of civilian veterans?</li>
      <li>Do the same for Male & Female. Which district has the largest percentage gap between men and women?</li>
      <li>Create a row for your state and calculate the average number of people with a bachelor's degree for the state as a whole, and then add a column to calculate the difference between each district and the average.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>SQL</strong>: Continuing with the senate voting database, write SQL to answer the following questions. You will need to study the fields in your tables.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How many votes on cloture motions were agreed to?</li>
        <li>What is the average number of Republican No votes on a vote where the question is On Passage of the Bill?</li>
        <li>Which Democratic senator has agreed with his/her party's majority position the most times?</li>
      </ol>
    
    <p>Email me the excel file with your "answers" in bold and the SQL from your queries by 5:20 p.m. on March 20.</p>

		<h5>Assignments for March 20</h5>

		<p><strong>PDFs</strong>: Find the Peace Corps rankings for large colleges and universities for 2010-2013 (4 years), and convert the PDF tables into a single spreadsheet with the year, college, number and rank. Using either Excel or SQLite (save the excel file as a CSV and import), answer the following question:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Which colleges have stayed in the top 25 all four years?</li>
		</ul>
	  <p><strong>Story Memo</strong>: Start keeping a log of your activities. <a href="data_log.pdf">Here's an example of a finished one</a> from a previous class.</p>

    <p>Email me the your Excel/SQLite file and any queries you wrote, plus your story memo log by 5:20 p.m. on March 20.</p>
