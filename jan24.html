		<h5>Assignments for Jan. 31</h5>
    <p><strong>First Critique</strong>: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-09-17-little-used-airports_N.htm">USA Today story on federal funding for smaller airports</a> (and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-09-16-airport-map_N.htm">accompanying map</a>). In reviewing this material, pay particular attention to how data drives the story and how the reporters used *and* explained it. Would you have done the same? Did they pay too much attention to some aspects and not enough to others? Was it clear to you what they did to arrive at their conclusions? Please critique both the story and map in at least 400 words. When in doubt about what to say, be specific. Don't say, "I liked it", or "I didn't like it". Tell me why.</p>

    <p><strong>Excel</strong>: Download <a href="http://apps.sos.wv.gov/elections/results/readfile.aspx?path=MTMvMTMtU3RhdGVDb3VudHlUb3RhbHMuY3N2">this CSV of West Virginia 2012 general election results</a> and copy OFFICIAL county-level results (the file contains both official and unofficial) for President Obama and Joe Manchin (U.S. Senate race) into a separate sheet, so that each county is a row and the columns contain the vote totals and percentages for both candidates (so you'll have columns with names like ObamaVotes, TotalVotes and ObamaPct, and ManchinVotes, TotalSenateVotes and ManchinPct). Be sure to save your file as an XLS file, not a CSV, then answer these questions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>In which counties did President Obama receive his highest and lowest percentages?</li>
      <li>How many counties did President Obama receive less than 50% of the vote?</li>
      <li>What was the largest difference in the number of votes between Manchin and Obama? Which county?</li>
      <li>What was the largest percentage difference between Manchin and Obama? Which county?</li>
      <li>Did President Obama receive a larger percentage of the vote than Manchin in any counties? Which ones?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Email me your critique, Excel file and answers by 6 p.m. on Jan. 31.</p>
